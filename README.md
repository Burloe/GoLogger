 A basic lightweight logging system for game events in into a .log file for Godot 4.<br><br>

## Introduction
Have you ever found yourself working on multiple new features or a large system involving numerous scripts, adding countless print statements to debug? This can clutter the output, making the information difficult to decipher and even harder to manage. Or perhaps you want your game to record events to help debug issues that your players encounter, especially when you can’t access their instance. In that case, creating a logging system to record game events could provide a snapshot of the events leading up to a bug or crash.

This project is a basic logging system designed to serve as a foundation for you to build upon. As such, it is intentionally minimalistic, making it flexible and scalable. With a few small adjustments, you can modify it to categorize events into separate files. The system logs any game event or data to a .log file, but it won’t automatically generate log entries once installed. However, using this plugin is as simple as writing a print() statement:
	
 	Log.entry("Your log entry message here!") # Result: [2024-09-10 12:04:58] Your log entry message here!

**Please note: This system is only as comprehensive and detailed as you make it.**<br><br><br>

## .log files
The system in it's current state uses two possible log files. 
 * DEVFILE - Located in the project directory at `res://GameLog/game.log`, this is intended for use during development. Since it's stored within the project files, it’s easily accessible.
 * FILE - Located in the User Data folder at "user://logs/game.log" alongside other log files generated by Godot. This should be used for release versions, as the DEVFILE will not be accessible once the project is built. The idea is that if a player encounters a bug or crash and reports it, you, as the developer, can ask them to include the log file with their bug report to gain insights into the chain of events leading to the issue.
 * To specify the log file location in your project, find the `Log.gd` file in the addon folder and modify this line:
   `const DEVFILE = "res://addons/GoLogger/game.log"`<br><br><br>

## Installation and setup:
The system requires an autoload to manage a signal and a few variables. To simplify and automate the installation process, a separate autoload (GoLogger.gd) is provided, containing just 8 lines of code. However, it is **highly** recommended that you incorporate this code into one of your existing autoloads instead. Steps for this is detailed in **Elaborate Setup**.

Basic installation:
* Download the plugin from either GitHub(!https://github.com/Burloe/GoLogger) or the Asset Library. If you download the .zip from GitHub, extract the addons folder to your PC then place it in your project's root directory. The folder structure should look like `res://addons/GoLogger`. 
* Navigate to `Project > Project Settings > Plugins`, where you should see "GoLogger" as an unchecked entry in the list of installed plugins. Check it to activate the plugin.
* Go into `Project > Project Settings > Globals > Autoload` and make sure the `GoLogger` autoload was added correctly. If not, you can add it manually by pressing the folder icon and finding `GoLogger.gd`, then restart Godot.
* Go to `Project > Project Settings > Globals > Autoload` and ensure that the GoLogger autoload has been added correctly. If not, you can manually add it by clicking the folder icon, locating GoLogger.gd, and restarting Godot.

### Simple setup - For a basic, standalone logging system:
1. To switch between saving logs in the project folder and the User Data folder, open GoLogger.gd. Set `log_in_devfile` to false to save logs in the User Data folder or true to save them in your project folder.
2. You can also change the location of the game.log file by changing the path for the constants. For example if you want to save the DEVFILE in a folder of the root: `const DEVFILE = "res://logs/game.log"`.

	
### Elaborate setup - For those intending to further improve and customize the system:
To make installation quick and easy, with minimal setup, an few additional script and two plugin files were added but frankly, they aren't strictly required. They are: GoLogger.gd, plugin.gd, and plugin.cfg. Only GoLogger.gd is required, but it can and **should** be merged into one of your existing autoloads. Due to the nature of static functions, the code must reside in an autoload. Here’s how:
1. Copy the code below and put it into any of your existing autoload scripts. Then delete GoLogger.gd:

It is REQUIRED to be an autoload! If your existing autoload already has a _ready() function declared, simply add the two _ready() lines from the code below inside your existing function.

	signal session_status_changed(status : bool) ## Session Status is changed whenever a session is started or stopped.
	var session_status: bool = false ## Flags whether a log session is in progress or not. 
	var log_in_devfile : bool = true ## Flags whether or not logs are saved using the [param FILE](false) or [param DEVFILE](true).
	
	func _ready() -> void:
		session_status_changed.connect(_on_session_status_changed) 
		Log.start_session() # Begins the logging seesion
	
	func _on_session_status_changed(status : bool) -> void:
		session_status = status
2. In Log.gd, use "Find and Replace" to update any code referencing the deleted `GoLogger` autoload with your own updated one.
	Note: The example scene script also references the GoLogger.gd script, so this will break the example scene. However, you can fix this by using "Find and Replace" in the example script "main.gd" as well. This doesn't affect the logging system itself, but if you try to open scene "main.tscn" after completing these steps, you may encounter a series of errors.

**4. Optional:** At this point, you can delete plugin.gd and plugin.cfg and continue using the scripts as is.<br><br><br>


## How to use:
Simply installing this plugin won't automatically generate log entries when you run your game. You still need to manually add log entries and specify the data each entry should display (if necessary). Fortunately, adding entries is as easy as writing print() calls, done with a single line of code:

	Log.entry("Your entry string here")
You can call this from any script in your project. The string message can contain almost any data, but you may need to convert that data into a string format using str(). For example:
	
 	Log.entry(str("Picked up item[", item_name, "] x", item_amount, "."))

Because this plugin is executed completely on the backend. The only out-of-the-box way to swap between using the DEVFILE and FILE is to manually set `log_in_devfile` to true/false. Adding a button or export variable can be done easily since there's no signals or code execution associated with the variable. It's not recommended to simply toggle the variable mid-session. Hotswapping the file used shouldn't cause any errors, you'd just end up with a fragmented file. But this is fixed by using the functions `stop_session()` and `start_session` before and after swapping the file respectively.

Since this plugin runs entirely in the background, the only built-in way to switch between the DEVFILE and FILE is to manually set `log_in_devfile` to true or false. Adding a button or export variable to handle this switch is simple, as there are no signals or additional code execution tied to the variable. However, it is not recommended to toggle the variable mid-session. While hotswapping the log file won't cause errors, it will result in fragmented log files. To avoid this, make sure to call stop_session() and start_session() functions before and after switching the log file, respectively. Example usage:

	func _on_button_up() ->:
 		Log.stop_session()                                  # Stop session prior to swapping file
 		GoLogger.log_in_devfile = !GoLogger.log_in_devfile  # Sets a false value to true and a true value to false
   		log.start_session()                                 # Begins a new session on the other file
